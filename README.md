# WRF - the Weather Research and Forecasting Model

__Note.__ This repo is not the main development trunk of WRF. If you are looking for that, go to http://www.wrf-model.org/index.php for more details. 

## Modifications to WRF
This repo contains the modifications I made to WRF for my PhD project: _Linking landscape evolution models with high-resolution meteorological data_.

The changes made to WRF were mainly in the idealised 2D hill case, to allow it to ingest a custom terrain 2D profile from a text file, to explore the effects of different terrain shapes and roughnesses on mesoscale dynamics. (It never actually made it into my thesis in the end so you are welcome to use it if you want to!)
